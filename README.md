The whole implementation for the segmentation can be seen in the [Cell segmentation notebook](https://github.com/eikekutz/deeplearning_project/blob/master/Cell_segmentation.ipynb)

The network model and the training script can be seen individually in [model folder](https://github.com/eikekutz/deeplearning_project/tree/master/model)

The data augmentation and all the helper functions are located in []()

###GAN based data augmentation approach
